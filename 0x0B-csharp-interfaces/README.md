| --------- | ----------- |
| 0-abstract_thinking/ <br> 0-abstract_thinking/0-abstract_thinking.csproj <br> 0-abstract_thinking/0-abstract_thinking.cs | **Task: 0. Abstract thinking** <br> An abstract class called `Base` containing the public property `name`, which must be a string. The class must override the `ToString()` method and return `<name> is a <type>`. |
| 1-user_interface/ <br> 1-user_interface/1-user_interface.csproj <br> 1-user_interface/1-user_interface.cs | **Task: 1. User interface** <br> Builds off the previous task, adds an interface called `IInteractive` with the method `void Interact()`. Another two interfaces are added as well: `IBreakable` with the property `durability` and the method `void Break()`, and the interface `ICollectable` with the property `isCollected` and the method `void Collect()`. It also adds a class called `TestObject` that inherits from `Base` and all three interfaces. |
| 2-doors/ <br> 2-doors/2-doors.csproj <br> 2-doors/2-doors.cs | **Task: 2. Escape room** <br> Builds off the previous task by deleting the `TestObject` class and creating the `Door` class which inherits from `Base` and `IInteractive`. `Interact()` was also implemented in order to print `You try to open the <name>. It's locked.`. |
| 3-decorations/ <br> 3-decorations/3-decorations.csproj <br> 3-decorations/3-decorations.cs | **Task: 3. Interior decorating** <br> Builds off the previous task by creating a class called `Decoration` that inherits from `Base`, `IInteractive`, and `IBreakable`. It contains the public bool `isQuestItem`, sets the value of `name`, `durability`, and `isQuestItem`, implements `Interact()`, and implements `Break()`. |
| 4-keys/ <br> 4-keys/4-keys.csproj <br> 4-keys/4-keys.cs | **Task: 4. Key collecting** <br> Builds off the previous task by implementing a class called `Key` that inherits from `Base` and `ICollectable`. It sets the value of `name` and `isCollected` and implements `Collect()`. |
| 5-iterate_act/ <br> 5-iterate_act/5-iterate_act.csproj <br> 5-iterate_act/5-iterate_act.cs | **Task: 5. Iterate and act** <br> Builds off the previous task by creating the class `RoomObjects` and the method `IterateAction`. This method takes a list of all objects, iterates through them, and executes methods depending on what interfact that item implements. |
| 6-generic_iteration/ <br> 6-generic_iteration/6-generic_iteration.csproj <br> 6-generic_iteration/6-generic_iteration.cs | **Task: 6. Better iterating and acting** <br> Builds off the previous task by removing the `RoomObjects` class and adding the generic class `Objs<T>` that creates a collection of type `T` objects. |
