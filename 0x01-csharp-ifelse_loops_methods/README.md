| --------- | ----------- |
| 0-positive_or_negative/<br> 0-positive_or_negative/0-positive_or_negative.csproj<br> 0-positive_or_negative/0-positive_or_negative.cs | **Task: 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing** <br> Completes this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.cs/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative.cs) in order to print whether the number stored in the `number` variable is positive, negative, or the number 0. |
| 1-last_digit/ <br> 1-last_digit/1-last_digit.csproj <br> 1-last_digit/1-last_digit.cs | **Task: 1. The last digit** <br> Completes this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.cs/blob/master/1-last_digit.cs) in order to print whether the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number` is greater than 6, is 0, or is less than 6 and not 0. |
| 2-print_alphabet/ <br> 2-print_alphabet/2-print_alphabet.csproj <br> 2-print_alphabet/2-print_alphabet.cs | **Task: 2. Run new project** <br> Prints the alphabet in lowercase and not followed by a newline by using `Console.Write` once and with one loop. |
| 3-print_alphabt/ <br> 3-print_alphabt/3-print_alphabt.csproj <br> 3-print_alphabt/3-print_alphabt.cs | **Task: 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off** <br> Prints every letter in the alphabet, except for `q` and `e`, in lowercase and not followed by a newline. This is done with one loop and by using `Console.Write` once. |
| 4-print_hexa/ <br> 4-print_hexa/4-print_hexa.csproj <br> 4-print_hexa/4-print_hexa.cs | **Task: 4. Hexadecimal printing** <br> Prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and it's equivalent hexadecimal value by using one loop and `Console.Write` once. |
| 5-print_comb/ <br> 5-print_comb/5-print_comb.csproj <br> 5-print_comb/5-print_comb.cs | **Task: 5. 00...99** Prints numbers from 00 to 99, with a `, ` between each one. The numbers are represented with two digits and the last one is followed by a newline. This is done by using one loop and Console.Write no more than twice. |
| 6-print_comb2/ <br> 6-print_comb2/6-print_comb2.csproj <br> 6-print_comb2/6-print_comb2.cs | **Task: 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need** <br> Prints all possible different combinations of two digits, where the two digits are different as `01` and `10` are considered the same combination of the digits `0` and `1`. No more than 2 loops can be used, and `Console.Write`/`Console.WriteLine` can't be used more than 3 times in total. |
| 7-islower/ <br> 7-islower/7-islower.csproj <br> 7-islower/7-islower.cs | **Task: 7. islower** <br> A method that checks for a lowercase character. The class name is `class Character`, with a prototype of `public static bool IsLower(char c)`, and returns `True` if `c` is lowercase and `False` otherwise. This is all done without using `Char.IsLower()` nor `Char.IsUpper()`. |
| 8-print_last_digit/ <br> 8-print_last_digit/8-print_last_digit.csproj <br> 8-print_last_digit/8-print_last_digit.cs | **Task: 8. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; its what we do with them that's important** A method that prints the last digit of a number. The class name is `class Number`, with a prototype of `public static int PrintLastDigit(int number)`, and returns the value of the last digit. |
| 9-add/ <br> 9-add/9-add.csproj <br> 9-add/9-add.cs | **Task: 9. a + b** <br> A method that adds two integers and returns the result. The class name is `class Number`, with a prototype of `public static int Add(int a, int b)`, and returns the value of `a` + `b`. |
| 10-print_line/ <br> 10-print_line/10-print_line.csproj <br> 10-print_line/10-print_line.cs | **Task: 10. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line** <br> A method that draws a straight line in the terminal. The class name is `class Line`, with a prototype of `public static void PrintLine(int Length)`, where `length` is the number of times the character `_` is printed. The line ends with a newline and if the `length` is `0` or less than it only prints the newline. |
| 11-print_diagonal/ <br> 11-print_diagonal/11-print_diagonal.csproj <br> 11-print_diagonal/11-print_diagonal.cs | **Task: 11. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe** <br> A method that draws a diagonal line in the terminal. The class name is `class Line` with a prototype of `public static void PrintDiagonal(int length)`, where the `length` is the number of times the character `\` is printed. The line ends with a newline and if the `length` is `0` or less than it only prints the newline. |
| 12-fizzbuzz/ <br> 12-fizzbuzz/12-fizzbuzz.csproj <br> 12-fizzbuzz/12-fizzbuzz.cs | **Task: 12. Fizz Buzz** <br> Prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. Instead of the number, `Fizz` is printed for multiples of 3, `Buzz` for multiples of 5, and `FizzBuzz` for multiples of both. The last element is followed by a newline. |
