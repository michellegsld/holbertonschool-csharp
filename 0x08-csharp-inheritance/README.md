| File Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 0-is/ <br> 0-is/0-is.csproj <br> 0-is/0-is.cs | **Task: 0. This is one of these** <br> A method that returns `True` if the object is an `int` or `False` otherwise. <ul><li>Class: `Obj`</li><li>Prototype: `public static bool IsOfTypeInt(object obj)`</li></ul> |
| 1-instance/ <br> 1-instance/1-instance.csproj <br> 1-instance/1-instance.cs | **Task: 1. For instance** <br> A method that returns `True` if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from `Array`, else returns `False`. <ul><li>Class: `Obj`</li><li>Prototype: `public static bool IsInstanceOfArray(object obj)`</li></ul> |
| 2-subclass/ <br> 2-subclass/2-subclass.csproj <br> 2-subclass/2-subclass.cs | **Task: 2. Only subclass** <br> A method that returns `True` if the object is an instance of a class that inherits from the specified class, otherwise returns `False`. The object must be a subclass as the method doesn't return `True` if the object is an instance of the base class. <ul><li>Class: `Obj`</li><li>Prototype: `public static bool IsOnlyASubclass(Type derivedType, Type baseType)`</li></ul> |
| 3-type_get/ <br> 3-type_get/3-type_get.csproj <br> 3-type_get/3-type_get.cs | **Task: 3. Type** <br> A method that prints the names of the available properties and methods of an object. <ul><li>Class: `Obj`</li><li>Prototype: `public static void Print(object myObj)`</li></ul> |
| 4-inherit/ <br> 4-inherit/4-inherit.cs <br> 4-inherit/4-inherit.csproj | **Task: 4. It's not a lesson in classes and inheritance without a Dog** <br> An empty class called `Dog` that inherits from the empty class `Animal`. <ul><li>Base Class: `Animal`</li><li>Derived Class: `Dog`</li></ul> |
| 5-shape/ <br> 5-shape/5-shape.csproj <br> 5-shape/5-shape.cs | **Task: 5. Basic shapes** <br> A class called `Shape` with a public method that throws an exception with a message. <ul><li>Class: `Shape`</li><li>public method: `public virtual int Area()`</li><li>exception thrown: `NotImplementedException`</li><li> Message Displayed: `Area() is not implemented`</li></ul> |
| 6-shape/ <br> 6-shape/6-shape.csproj <br> 6-shape/6-shape.cs | **Task: 6. Rectangle** <br> Based on `5-shape`, a class called `Rectangle` that inherits from `Shape`. The class `Rectangle` had two private fields: `private int width` and `private int height`. It also had two public properties: `public int Width` and `public int Height`. For the first public property, `get` retrieves the `width`. `set` would set the `width` to a value, unless the value was negative, in which case, `ArgumentException` was thrown with the message `Width must be greater than or equal to 0`. For the other public property, `get` retrieves the `height`. `set` would set the `height` to a value, unless the value was negative, in which case, `ArgumentException` was thrown with the message `Height must be greater than or equal to 0`. |
| 7-shape/ <br> 7-shape/7-shape.csproj <br> 7-shape/7-shape.cs | **Task: 7. Full rectangle** <br> Based on `6-shape`, adds two public methods: `public new int Area()`, which will override the `Area()` method in the `Shape` base class, and `public override ToString()`, which returns `[Rectangle] <width> / <height>`. |
| 8-shape/ <br> 8-shape/8-shape.csproj <br> 8-shape/8-shape.cs | **Task: 8. Square #1** <br> Based on `7-shape`, a class called `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle`. It has the private field `private int size` and public property `public int Size`. The public property's `get` retrieves `size`, while the `set` will assign the values to `size`, `height`, and `width`. If the value sent into `set` was negative, then an `ArgumentException` was thrown with the message `Size must be greater than or equal to 0`. |
| 9-shape/ <br> 9-shape/9-shape.csproj <br> 9-shape/9-shape.cs | **Task: 9. Square #2** <br> Based on `8-shape`, adds to it. `Area()` works without creating a new `Area()` method within the `Square` class, and `.ToString()` returns `[Square] <size> / <size>`. |
